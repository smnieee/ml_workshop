        "This machine learning workshop will build on our prior workshops. We will cover additional topics in supervised learning. From a design perspective, we will discuss splitting data into testing, training, and validation sets. This is critical to properly fitting the learning algorithms to the data. We will also discuss problems that may arise, such as over fitting to the data. Join us as we expand into practical considerations for implementation of supervised learning algorithms.\n"

        "The training set was used to fit the hyperparameters of the model to the data. The testing set was then used to calculate the error in the model. This lead to a loop over epochs where the model fit was refined and the error remeasured until a sufficient fit was achieved.\n",
